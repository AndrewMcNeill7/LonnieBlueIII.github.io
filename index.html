                        Hello!
                        My name is Lonnie Blue III, I’m currently a junior majoring in Business Administration at Towson
                        University. I am a hard worker driven by the moral compass instilled
                        in me by my parents. They taught me how to not judge a person by their appearance and always
                        lend a helping hand because not everyone is as fortunate as myself whether it's
                        where they grew up or who they had raised them. The most important thing about me is that I am
                        my father’s son and to me, that speaks volumes about the man I aspire to be one day.
                        The different trials and tribulations I witnessed him go through helped me keep my head up and
                        make me proud to be named Lonnie Blue.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        When I first learned about Kappa Alpha Psi Fraternity Inc. I thought that it was just a way to
                        make connections through a brotherhood that ended in college, but after I met different
                        members who gave their points of view on it I saw it completely differently. I now see it as a
                        lifestyle of achieving at everything one does in life and that the brotherhood lasts forever.
                        Not only that but I see the way members of Kappa Alpha Psi Fraternity Inc. act and it shows me
                        how they truly embody their goals and they truly do achieve in life. These are some of the
                        reasons
                        why I would like to become a member of this fraternity.

                        If I were given the opportunity to become a member not only would I be active on campus but I
                        would look to help the younger generation. My belief is that the basic fundamentals we learn are
                        given to us as kids when we are in grade school whether it's elementary, middle, or high school.
                        This is why I would try to volunteer at grade schools to help give the kids something to
                        remember whether
                        it was reading their favorite story or giving them useful tips to help them in life. This would
                        also give the kids some exposure to greek life whereas most people don’t become exposed until
                        they're in college.
